# 06_Homework_Server_side_APIs_Weather_Dashboard

## Description

The motivation for this project was to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The dashboard uses the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities.

I learnt about using API's to retrieve information, API keys, Javascript functions, event handlers and algorithms, CSS, HTML, local storage, and much more.
